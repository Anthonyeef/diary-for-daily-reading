## Android
Ya today I finished the project: [FanfouDaily](https://github.com/Anthonyeef/FanfouDaily). Now it's functional and I just build the first release apk.

### The use of gradle
Mainly from the blog posts of stormzhang, [here](http://stormzhang.com/devtools/2015/01/05/android-studio-tutorial5/) and [here](http://stormzhang.com/devtools/2015/01/15/android-studio-tutorial6/). I also check some repo on GitHub and learn how to use Fir, Umeng as analysistic tool and bug chasing tool.

Main points:
- Add Umeng & Fir gradle compile in local gradle build file.
- Add method in acticity & fragment
- Initialize in Application class
- Add needed permission in `AndroidManifest.xml` file
- Edit the `build.gradle` like the post say
- Run command in terminal, and wait until the compile work done

The remaining work for this project would be:

- Add about page of programmer
- Add self update method from Fir
- Add night mode
- Add multi languages support
- Add footer for the `Fragmentweekly`
- Make icon for it
- Build home page for this project


### GitHub release
Creating release apk file for my project, and get to know another Git command: `git tag`, which would be used specificly tag system for important points(for example I finally make my release apk)
