## OAuth
I finnal find out the implement of OAuth.

1. Set up a Consume Key--> RequestToken 
2. RequestToken --> Callback url for authorization
3. The RequestToken is valid now, and use it to ask for AccessToken
4. Save the AccessToken and use it to access 


The progress is clear, while things still remain complex for implementation. I try in Retrofit + OkHttp and still don't know how to do it.

However the Fanfou OAuth also supply XAuth. And there is a library extends from Scribe which could be implemented easily.

I will try tonight.
