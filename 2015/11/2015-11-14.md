- It should be avoid creating request queue each time, which will end up with memory leaks and other problems.
- Create a singleton class referenced using static, globally visible variable, to handle the `RequestQueue`. The extending the `Application` class to tell the operation system to generate this object at application startup, even before the first activity is created.

### Retrofit: working with APIs on Android

Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android and Java.

- Api interface declare:
```Java
public interface TaskService {
    @GET("/task/{id}/subtasks")
    List<Task> listSubTasks(@Path("id") String taskId);
}
```
`id` with annotation @Path should match the placeholder within the annotation @GET. The second line is the constructor of the function.

- RestAdapter
Code snippet:

```Java
RestAdapter restAdapter = new RestAdapter.Builder()
        .setEndpoint("https://end.point.com")
        .build();
TaskService service = restAdapter.create(TaskService.class);

```
Then we can use the `service`:
```Java
List<Task> task = service.listSubTasks("specific-id");
```
Which will make a synchronous call of method `GET`.


**If you make a synchronous method on the main thread, Android before 4.0 will crash and throw a `NetworkOnMainThreadException` error**.

Ya and it's exactly what I met when playing with the example on the book.
