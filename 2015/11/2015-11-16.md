### Retrofit chapter 3
- Using Retrofit converters to replace the default GSON converter, by using the following code:

```Java
RestAdapter adapter = new RestAdapter.Builder()
        .setClient(new okClient(new OkHttpClient())
        .setEndpoint(yourBaseUrl)
        .setConverter(new SimpleXMLConverter())
        .build();
```

- It should be fine to use more than one network library in application, but Retrofit can provide different adapters to fit like xml response.
