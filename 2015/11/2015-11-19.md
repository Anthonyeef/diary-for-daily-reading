## Android
 My plan for the coming days: build a new project(for internship) and start to read the code of Minicat seriously.

 Also get to know more about Retrofit, algorithm, data structure.

 ### Read source code of a Dribbble app
 - **ListView** can add scrollfreiction by: `mList.setFriction(ViewConfiguration.getScrollFriction())`;
 - Create a customize cardview:

```Java
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android>
    <stroke android:width="1px"
            android:color="#ffd8d8d8"/>
    <corners android:radius="5dp" />
    <solid android:color="@color/content_back />
</shape>
```
 The code demostrate one thind: the element of a cardview shape is: 
    - The stroke("line")
    - The corner properties( radius for example)
    - The solid part property(color for example)
 Thus can define a certain shape.

### Fresco: the Facebook image library
- Android does the garbage collection job after stop the app.
- Fresco: fast UI and fast memory. Pin the memory in advance of the UI thread.
- `With great power comes great responsibility.`
- `DraweeHierarchy`: MVC-like framework for display of images: imaging,layering,fade-in,and scaling.`DraweeControllers`:controller of view, handle placeholder, error condition and finished image.
- Only `DraweeView` needed to be instantiate, set a URI and some other parameters.
