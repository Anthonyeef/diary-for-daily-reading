## Android
### [Migrate old project ot AppCompat Library](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Migrating-to-the-AppCompat-Library)

- Support.v4 library is no longer needed. AppCompat library has an implicit dependency on the support v4 library. 
- Apache HTTP Client has been removed and need to add additional code in gradle;

### Reading code

- Start a new window with a url:
```Java
public void onClick(View view) {
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
    intent.setData(Uri.parse(URL_WANTED_TO_GO);
    startActivity(intent);
}
```

### [Pick Image from Gallery with Intents](http://codetheory.in/android-pick-select-image-from-gallery-with-intents/)

- ACTION_PICK method is deprecated. Use `ACTION_GET_CONTENT` instead.
- Code snippet: open a image selector:

```Java
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setType("image/*");
intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
startActivityForResult(Intent.createChooser(intent, "Select Picture"), PICK_IMAGE_REQUEST);


private int PICK_IMAGE_REQUEST = 1;
```
- I met the permission missing error after I update the library and  run the code. After think of it for almost two days and I finnally get this answer from stackoverflow [fix everything](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33292700/2761728). That's because for API 23+ I am ask for read/write permissions even if they are already defined in manifest file.
