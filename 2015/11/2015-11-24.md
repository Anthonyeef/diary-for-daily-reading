- gradle 2.0.0 needed, which is still in alpha;
- In fact I can see almost all the modules should be the newest;
- And instant run can only be used in the following method:
    - Add/remove/change annotations
    - Add/remove/change an instance field
    - Add/remove/change a static field
    - Add/remove a static method signature
    - Change a static method signature
    - Add/remove an instance method 
    - Change an instance method signature
    - Changing which parent class the current class inherits from
    - Change the list of implemented interfaces
