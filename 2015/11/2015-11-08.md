### Using Android Studio to assembleRelease apk
It's quite simple with the help of Android Studio. After setting up some code in build.gradle, like set up the `productFlavors` and put the market's name inside. Then go to the menu bar of Android Studio and click `build` --> `Generate signed apk`.

Keystore file is needed. Run command:
```bash
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore
-alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

From developer [guide](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html) here would generate a keystore file. It's neccesary when generating a signed apk later.
