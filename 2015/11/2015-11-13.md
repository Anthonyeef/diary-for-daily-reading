## Android
### [Volley](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-volley--cms-23800)
- Reason of using `Volley`: faster, cache, asynchronous(no AsyncTask anymore)
- Work flow:

    - `MainThread` takes control of the UI, handle with the response.
    - `Volley` will check the cache first before the `Network request` thread.

- `RequestQueue`: manage worker threads and delivers the parsed results back to the main thread. `Request` were passed to it.
- `Request`: the constructor always with parameter `GET`,`POST` etc and URL, event listener.
- `Listener`: with `onResponse` and `onError`, similar to `AsyncTask`.\
- **There should be only one `RequestQueue` and share it through different activities & fragments**. To instantiate one singleton and use it cross the project.

#### Request type:
- `StringRequest`,`ImageRequest` and `JsonRequest`
- First parameter is the http method(like `GET`). Second one is the `URL`. Third one could be `null` & can be the head information if you need to pretend to be a pc browser. Finnaly is listener.



### [Dependency injection with dagger 2](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/dependency-injection-with-dagger-2-on-android--cms-23345)
- When having an object that needs or depends on another object to work, that's dependency.
- Dagger create a factory object to make one, and to supply other class that need this dependency without creating a new one by itself.

### [PreferenceFragment](http://codetheory.in/saving-user-settings-with-android-preferences/)
- Use `PreferenceFragment` rather than using `PreferenceActivity`: more flexible and reusable.
- Code snippet:
```Java
getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
    .replace(android.R.id.content, new SettingsFragment())
    .commit();
```

And inside the `SettingFragment`:
```Java
addPrefeencesFromResource(R.xml.user_settings);
```
Thus load the Preferences from the `user_settings.xml` file. **Notice**: do not need to use `setContentView` method in `Activity`' `onCreate()`.

And `addPreferencesFromResource` is deprecated in `Activity`.

- Initializing the `SharedPreferences` with default value:
In the `MainAcrtivity` or `Application`, use this code:

```Java
PreferenceManager.setDefaultValues(this, R.xml.user_settings, false);
```
    - `this`: the context
    - `R.xml.user_settings`: Resource id of the preference XML file
    - `false`: the default value will only be set once.

- `header`: in case having too much sub options. See [doc](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html#PreferenceHeaders)
