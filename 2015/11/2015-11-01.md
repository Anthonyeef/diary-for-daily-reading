### AsyncTask usage

If I want to use `AsyncTask` to manage multi thread task, keep in mind:
- Do the download data job in `doInBackground`. Including the Json parsing, and the other tasks.
- Do the update UI job in `onPostExcute`. Like setting adapter, put the downloaded data into the array list, and manage the click listener within the adapter should be one of the method.
- When doing `doInBackground`, the return result should be some kind of flag to pass information to `onPostExecute`. For example, to tell it that: sucessfully downloaded data and you can update with the latest data; or: downloaded data failed and you could use the data from database of cache.
