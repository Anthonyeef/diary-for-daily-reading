## Android
- Use **sp** when defining the size of text.
- Use **dp** when defining padding & margin.
 
### [Designers' guide to dpi](http://sebastien-gabriel.com/designers-guide-to-dpi/)

 - DPI: dots per inch. Used in print, means the number of drops your printer can put in one inch. 
 - PPI: pixel per inch. The same idea but pixel here, used in screen.
 - A screen with lower PPI will display the image bigger than the design protype.
 - If reduce the resolution on a 27" Cinema Display screen, the elements will appear bigger.
 - Thus px can't be measure unit.
 - Retina: The PPI of the device is so high that the human's retina was supposedly not able to distinguish the pixels on the screen. In a word it's to display more pixel in same screen size.
 - DP: Device independent pixel, is Android thing, PT: point, is Apple thing. But they are essentially the same thing. Android and iOS will adapt the size to the screen and convert with the right multiplier.
 - SP: Works the same way but for the font. Scale independent pixels.

 **Tip:** Always use resolution/scale independent values when specing.
