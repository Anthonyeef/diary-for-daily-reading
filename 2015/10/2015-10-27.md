## Django
I ran into Django yesterday and found it quite easy to understand. Yesterday I went to the 3C society here in this university and the tutor introduced how Django work. I read through the [Django Girls Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html) on GitHub.

- `Virtualenv` is a powerful tool that allow the user to choose different version of Django in actual work environment. In the tutorial it doesn't look that important because you can use Django 1.8 and finish all the project, but may in the actual work will it be very convinient to switch to another version.
- The website built with Django should be deploy on a VPS but not on GitHub page. The site requires python to do some dynamic rendering while the GitHub Page only support static site. That's why the tutorial is using pythonanywhere to deploy the project and some blog post suggest Heroku.
- I read another tutorial written in Chinese which I think is a little bit better than the Django Girls Tutorial. See [here](http://andrewliu.in/2014/12/22/Django%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E7%AE%80%E6%98%93%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B-%E4%B8%80-Django%E7%AE%80%E4%BB%8B/).
