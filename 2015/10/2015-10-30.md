### Butterknife

I take a look inside `Minicat` just know and try to find out the way it display CSS style in `TextView`, and saw a method I have never seen before while using `Butterknife`. There is a `inject` method, something like:

```Java
Butterknife.inject(this, view);
```

When look at the source code of the `Butterknife` library in `Minicat`, I figure out that the `inject` function is exactly the pre version of `bind`. `Minicat` is still using the old version of `Butterknife`(version 6.0) and the newest one should be 7.\* . Apparently the author of `Butterknife` have replace `inject` with `bind`.

### Customize the TextView

I need to add some CSS style to make my status in FanfouDaily look better. Now the text in the textview is just plain text.
