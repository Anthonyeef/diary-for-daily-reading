[Livid 专访](https://ipn.li/kernelpanic/26/)

Livid is the creator of [V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com), which is a famous forum for programmer & designer & Internet lovers.

I admire Livid's attitude toward the world, no matter in program's or the real one. May there be some meme about what he has done, he is still someone that I would like to learn from.

「要么孤独，要么平庸」
'You can choose to become alone or common.'
I think 「平庸」here means no attribution to the world.
