[Livid 专访](https://ipn.li/kernelpanic/26/)

Livid is the creator of [V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com), which is a famous forum for programmer & designer & Internet lovers.

I admire Livid's attitude toward the world, no matter in program's or the real one. May there be some meme about what he has done, he is still someone that I would like to learn from.

「要么孤独，要么平庸」
'You can choose to become alone or common.'
I think 「平庸」here means no contribution to the world.

## Framerjs

Framer is a prototype tool for building web & mobile app. Sketch prototype is needed, and you need to import from Sketch to start a Framer project.

### Creating new layer and a block in the center position

```
bg = new BackgroundLayer
    backgroundColor: "#28affa"

layerA = new Layer
    backgroundColor: "white", opacity: 0.5
    borderRadius: ""
layerA.center()

print "Hello"
```
- The numerical value of radius is good, cause it can be use to add animation to the object.
- The preset scale of a layer is width = 100 and height = 100. so if you hit:
    ```
    scale = 2
    ```
  will increase the width and height to 200.
- A concept of "frame". when you create a layer, you make a new fram.
    ```
    constraints = new layer
        scale: 3
        backgroundColor: "white"
    constraints.center()

    layerA.draggable.constraints = constraints.frame
This will make layerA only draggable inside the layer constraint.
- The feature of layer Constraints is actually not neccesarry. We only need the x y z value of the layer and set it as the constraints of layerA.

- There are three variaties of spring. First is tension(the weight of the flying ball), the friction(the bouncing effect of the ball) and the velocity(the initial speed). More details can be found here [Animating with Framerjs](http://www.stakelon.com/2014/05/animating-with-framer-js/).
