## Java
Currently reading <Data Structure & Algorithms in Java, Wiley>. Cause I sometimes felt some missing knowlege of Java language.

- 
    ```Java
    Counter c;
    c = new Counter();
    ```
    The first line of code only give c the reference variable. And the second line give `c` an instance. This would avoiding the lack of an object cause the default value of the adress stored in reference variable is `null`, that's the default standard value.

- If the `dot` operator is used on a reference that is currently `null`, the Java runtime enviroment will return with `NullPointerError`.
- And for the multi constructors case, Java works like the C++ way.
- Access control modifiers
