### Realm: a replacement for SQLite & Core Data

Realm is a mobile database. It's not an ORM(Object-relational mapping) on top of SQLite and it's perticular designed for mobile database, which is the reason it has many unique features: simplicity, speed.

And the reason I chose it for my project is, SQLite grammar is complex to write...

Documentation is [here](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/) for Android development. BTW, the Java version of Realm is for Andoird only...

### Add

Add compile 'io.realm:realm-android:0.83.1' to the dependencies of your project.(the version code may change with time)
 
### Usage

After create the POJO model for the project, extends from RealmObject.

``` Java
public class User extends RealmObject {

    @PrimaryKey
    private String          name;
    private int             age;

    @Ignore
    private int             sessionId;

    // Standard getters & setters generated by your IDE…
    public String getName() { 
    	return name; 
    	}
    public void   setName(String name) { 
    	this.name = name; 
    	}
    public int    getAge() { 
    	return age; 
    	}
    public void   setAge(int age) { 
    	this.age = age; 
    	}
    public int    getSessionId() { 
    	return sessionId; 
    	}
    public void   setSessionId(int sessionId) { 
    	this.sessionId = sessionId; 
    	}
}
```
