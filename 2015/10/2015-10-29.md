### RecyclerView

Thinking about adding `OnClickListener` to the RecyclerView item in my project. I knew there is not `OnClickListener` in RecyclerView(so RecyclerView is not one handred percent replacement of ListView I would say) for quite a while, and knowing that there should be some trick to add it.

Useful resources is here from [Little Robots](http://www.littlerobots.nl/blog/Handle-Android-RecyclerView-Clicks/). And the main consideration is, though there is not `OnClickeListener` we can use directly, there is one even more powerful tool called `OnTouchListener`. All we need to do is to customize `OnTouchListener` by making a `ItemClickSupport` class.

Following that post I create the OnClickListener I want and it works very nice.

### Snackbar
Use `Snackbar` to replace Toast and test the behavior of `click` action is really useful. And the impliment of `Snackbar` is quite similar to `Toast`.

```Java
Snackbar.make(parentView, R.string.snackbar_text, Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG)
  .setAction(R.string.snackbar_action, myOnClickListener)
  .show(); // Donâ€™t forget to show!
```

The first parameter can be many choice. For example in my case I use the `view` of the item and it works. Scanning the Google's document and it says that this function will find the parent view by itself so developer don't need to worry about it.

And there is some way to customize the `Snackbar` to make it colorful:

```Java
Snackbar.make(parentView, R.string.snackbar_text, Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG)
 .setAction(R.string.snackbar_action, myOnClickListener)  // action text on the right side
 .setActionTextColor(R.color.green)
 .setDuration(3000).show();
```

The source is from [CodePath](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-the-Snackbar). I learn quite a lot from this website.

### Start a Fragment & Activity from a Fragment & Activity

There may be four condition: 
1. from `fragment` to `fragment`
2. from `fragment` to `activity`
3. from `actitity` to `fragment`
4. from `activity` to `activity

The last one should be the easiest one. Attention we also need to pass data to the upcoming activity & fragment.
