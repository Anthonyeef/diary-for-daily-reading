Start to try leetcode from today :)

- Nim Game
    The solution of this one is to find out the regulation of winning the game. If there is only one stone, or two stone, or three stone, then I as the first one to play should definitely win the game. And start from 4 I would lost. If it's 5? I can make it `4` by removing one stone, so the compatitor will be the one who is facing the issue that he(or she) would be the one who take stone first while there is 4 stone (and he will lose according to my explaination before). So
    if it's 5 & 6 & 7, I would win; If it's 8, I would lost.

    Now the winning pattern show up! The one who takes the stone first would lose the game only if the number is `4* n`. So the solution:
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    public:
        bool canWinNim(int n) {
        return !(n % 4 == 0);
      }
    };
    ```
