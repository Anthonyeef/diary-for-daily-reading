### [RecyclerView](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidRecyclerView/article.html)
- This article actually doesn't tell much about the usage of RecyclerView, and more focus on the concept.

- Data should be fetched first, then bind to the RecyclerView adapter inside the Fragment / Activity.

- The podcast mentioned there is nice.

### [Gson:from codepath](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Leveraging-the-Gson-Library)
- Gson will map the fields automatically and no annotations needed;
- Parsing the response: Gson has it's method.

```Java
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().create();
Model item  = gson.fromJson(response,  Model.class);
return item;
```
- Annotation `@SerializedName` is used when the name is different from the name field we define.
- Special naming policy can be added between GsonBuilder and the `create()` method. For example:
```Java
gsonBuilder.setFieldNamingPolicy(FieldNamingPolicy.LOWER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES);
```
- If the response contains a list of object, there is method to map a list of response:

```Java
Type collectionType = new TypeToken<List<ImageResult>>(){}.getType;
Gson gson = gsonBuilder.create();
List<ImageResult> imageResults = gson.fromJson(jsonObject, collectionType);
```
