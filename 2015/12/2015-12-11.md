### [ Droidcon Jake Wharton simple http Retrofit 2](https://realm.io/news/droidcon-jake-wharton-simple-http-retrofit-2/)

- Just explain some key features of Retrofit 2.0. And some naive man commit that it will be out by the end of this year.

### [When using SimpleXmlConvertor with Retrofit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31755873/build-errors-with-xml-to-java-object-converter-dependency-in-build-gradle-for-re)
- Create Object to map the response is the key point of using SimpleXmlConvertor.
- Annotations like *Element* and *Root* is needed.
- Still trying to find method to get the whole xml response instead. Maybe use Retrofit Log today.
